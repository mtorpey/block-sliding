This is a basic collection of functions for solving block-sliding puzzles in
GAP - http://www.gap-system.org/

To use it, open a GAP session, making sure the orb package is loaded, then read
in `block-sliding.g`, and call `solve_game_file` with a valid game file.
Example game files can be found in the `examples` directory.

For example, starting GAP from inside the `block-sliding` directory:

```
gap> LoadPackage("orb");
gap> Read("block-sliding.g");
gap> solve_game_file("examples/HuarongDao.txt");
```

A valid solution to the puzzle will be printed to the screen, if one is found.
